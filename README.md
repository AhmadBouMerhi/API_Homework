# OpenWeatherMap_API

This project uses Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
The project is called "WeatherPy", it's creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, the project uses a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API.
it builds a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

-Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

-Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

-Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

-Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


The projects uses  Jupyter notebook, Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
